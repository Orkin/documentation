Your application is running, but something goes wrong? In this guide, you'll learn how to debug your application and solve your problem to
make it running smoothly.

<Assumptions>

* You have already deployed an application with Qovery

</Assumptions>

Your application is running, but for some reason, it is not working as expected. Here are a few tips to find out what's going on.

## Check the status of your app

To find out what is the status of your application, you can follow these steps:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Choose your project and environment

</li>
<li>

In environment overview, you can see the status of the whole environment as well as statuses of individual applications:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/debugging/debugging-1.png" alt="Debugging" />
</p>

- As you can see in the screenshot, the environment is `RUNNING`. 

- `twitter-backend` and `my-db` application statuses are marked as green dots, which means they are up and running as well. 

- On the other hand, the `my-mysql` database is marked with a grey dot, which means it was not deployed or is stopped.

- If the service crashes, its status is marked with a red dot.

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

## Logs

If you need to see the log output of your application while it's running, follow these steps:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Choose your project, environment, and application.

</li>
<li>

In the application overview, click the `Show Logs` button

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/debugging/debugging-3.png" alt="Debugging" />
</p>

This will open a view of your application logs:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/debugging/debugging-4.png" alt="Debugging" />
</p>

- Timestamp: the timestamp of the message
- Pod Name: the name of the kubernetes pod where your application is running (to distinguish the instance in case of multi-instance app). If you want to follow a specific pod, you can filter the logs by clicking on the pod name
- Commit Id: the commit id of the application running on this POD
- Message: the log message

You can use this information to find out what causes your application to behave incorrectly.

</li>
</ol>

</Steps>

## Deployment Logs

If your application fails to start, you can check what's the cause in its deployment logs:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Choose your project and environment.

</li>
<li>

In environment overview, click `Show Logs` button:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/debugging/debugging-7.png" alt="Debugging" />
</p>

This will open a view of your deployment logs:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/debugging/debugging-8.png" alt="Debugging" />
</p>

This view provides insight into the build and deployment process. If anything goes wrong, you can see all the required information to fix the problem here.

</li>
</ol>

</Steps>

## Monitoring

If you need more information about the resources consumed by your application, Qovery provides basic metrics about your CPU, memory and storage usage.

<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Choose your project, environment, and application.

</li>
<li>

In the main application view, you can see charts and an overview of your application resource consumption.

<p align="center">

</p>

</li>
</ol>

<Alert type="warning">
  Historical metrics are coming soon!
</Alert>

## Alerting
We highly recommend using tools like [Datadog][urls.datadog], [Sentry][urls.sentry] or [NewRelic][urls.new_relic] to manage your alerting.
Qovery will provide easy integrations in the coming release. Check out our [roadmap][urls.qovery_roadmap]
