<Alert type="info">

Important note: this tutorial is a temporary workaround to consume the Qovery API - an official way will be provided soon.

</Alert>

The Qovery API can be used to create personal integrations that will help you manage your projects on Qovery. They work just like normal HTTP requests and require a bit of knowledge working with APIs.

Let's get started!!

## Getting an authorization key

<Alert>

The Qovery API works by using authorization keys. Currently, it is only possible to get a key by monitoring your network traffic (nothing to be afraid of, everything will be explained below) and getting one from there. You will also need to change the key rather frequently as that changes everytime. The Qovery team is working on improving this process!

</Alert>

1) Head on to the Qovery console.

<%= qovery_sign_up() %>

2) Head to any project.

### Getting our token

3) Open your browser developer console. Usually this is as simple as clicking CTRL + Shift + I

4) Head to the network tab, then click on the network tab.

5) Now, refresh your page, and look for a random request (usually from api.qovery.com), then click on it to inspect it's body. Once you do, you'll see that it has a header as a token.

6) Copy the token, then move to the next section.

<Alert type="warning">

Make sure not to leak this token anywhere, or else unauthorized users can have access to your account, something you do not want. Additionally, you must copy your token every time you try to use the API as it changes every once in a while. This will be changed in the future, along with the way you are provided with the token (Console panel).

</Alert>

## Using the API

<Alert type="info">

This part of the tutorial will be showing off a few out of the hundreds of functions of the Qovery API. All the endpoints work the same way, so there is no point outlining all of them here. For all the endpoints, you can click [here](https://api-doc.qovery.com) to learn more.

</Alert>

In order to use the API, you can use any available websites/tools, like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or the programming language of your choice along with the appropriate library to make HTTP requests (eg. requests for Python).

For this demo, I will be using Postman as it's my go-to for using and testing APIs. The point of this tutorial isn't about Postman, so I will not be going in depth about how to use it. You can check out their learning center [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) to learn more.


Below, I will be trying to learn more about my application using the [Get Application by ID](https://api-doc.qovery.com/#tag/Application-Main-Calls) endpoint.

1) Grab the token you copied before, and paste it in the authorization tab in the collection menu (refer above to the learning center).

2) Create a new request, then grab the URL from the API website. For this request, we need to get our application ID.

### Getting the needed IDs

2.1) Go to your application in the console, and look at the URL. It should look something like this:

```
https://console.qovery.com/platform/organization/xxx/projects/xxx/environments/xxx/applications/xxx/summary
```

2.2) You must copy the ID that's right next to the "applications/" part.

2.3) Paste that ID where it is needed. In this case, remove "{applicationId}" and paste it there.

<Alert>

With this method, you can also grab your organization ID, project ID and environment ID as well.

</Alert>

### Receiving the output

3) If everything was done correctly, Postman (or the tool you are using) should output all the information regarding your application.

</p>

## Common mistakes

### Wrong token

Make sure you are copying the token correctly every time. Do note that you must copy it every time you are making a request as the token gets refreshed as noted above. Refer to the [getting an autorization key](#getting-an-authorization-key) section of this tutorial.

### Wrong IDs

Make sure you are copying the correct IDs you need. For example, if you need your organization ID, copy the ID that is next to the "/organization" URI. For more infomation, refer to the [getting the needed IDs](#getting-the-needed-ids) section.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now know everything you need to know regarding the Qovery API and how to use it! Should you run into any issues, feel free to join the [Qovery Discord server](https://discord.qovery.com) and ask for help there!
