You can find additional information on the [Qovery trust page](https://trust.qovery.com/).

All customers using Qovery, requiring to be SOC2 compliant, save a lot of time as the deployed infrastructure is SOC2 ready!

In this documentation, you will find settings to update to comply with SOC2 and even more.

## Cluster advanced settings

In the [cluster advanced settings][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cluster-advanced-settings], you will find several options to update based on your wishes and to comply with SOC2. Here are the most important ones:

### Log retention days
* AWS Cloudwatch retention days (aws.cloudwatch.eks_logs_retention_days): 365 days is what SOC2 requests at least
* Enable VPC flow logs (aws.vpc.enable_s3_flow_logs and aws.vpc.flow_logs_retention_days): Enable it and set the retention days to 365 days
* Allowed databases CIDR: you can disable or restrict public access
