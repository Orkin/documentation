import Alert from '@site/src/components/Alert';

<Alert type="success">

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with [Terraform][docs.devops.infrastructure-as-code.terraform] and our [REST API][docs.using-qovery.interface.rest-api] to manage Qovery and deploy your apps.

</Alert>

Qovery provides a [management console][urls.start_qovery] which allows you to interact with your projects and manage your environments.

## First sign-up

Sign in to the [Qovery web interface][urls.start_qovery].

<Alert type="info">

When you first sign into the Qovery Console, you need to provide your Git provider account credentials. This allows you to later take advantage of a Single Sign-On process through your Git provider. However, by default, Qovery is then allowed to access all the resources stored on your Git provider account. 

For better control, as a Github user, you can install the Qovery Github App, and define which Github repositories Qovery can access. For more information, see [Managing Git Permissions with the Qovery Github App][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization#managing-git-permissions-using-the-qovery-github-app].

## Deploy your first application

Now that you have signed up on the web interface, check out [how to deploy your first application][guides.deploy-your-first-application]
