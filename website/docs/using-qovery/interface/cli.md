<Alert type="success">

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with [Terraform][docs.devops.infrastructure-as-code.terraform] and our [REST API][docs.using-qovery.interface.rest-api] to manage Qovery and deploy your apps.

</Alert>

Qovery provides a very easy to use CLI (Command Line Interface) designed to fit the developer workflow perfectly.

----

The purpose of the CLI is to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

1. Write code
2. Commit
3. **Qovery** - deploy a new version of your application
4. **Qovery CLI** - check the status of your application
5. **Qovery CLI** - debug your application
6. Repeat

## First usage

### Install

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"linux"}
  placeholder="Select your OS"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Platforms","label":"Linux","value":"linux"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"MacOS","value":"macos"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Windows","value":"windows"}]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
# Download and install Qovery CLI on every Linux distribution
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | sudo bash
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="homebrew"
  values={[{"label":"Homebrew","value":"homebrew"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="homebrew">

The common solution to install a command line binary on the MacOS is to use [Homebrew][urls.brew].

```bash
# Add Qovery brew repository
$ brew tap Qovery/qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ brew install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

```bash
# Install the Qovery CLI on MacOS manually
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="scoop"
  values={[{"label":"Scoop","value":"scoop"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="scoop">

The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop][urls.scoop].

```bash
# Add Qovery bucket
$ scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ scoop install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

Install the Qovery CLI on Windows manually by downloading the [latest realease][urls.qovery_cli_releases], and uncompress its content to
`C:\Windows`.

</TabItem>

### Sign up

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth
```

<Alert type="info">

If you are using an environment without access to GUI or a browser, you can use headless authentication instead:

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth --headless
```

</Alert>

Your browser window with sign-in options will open.

Congratulations, you are logged-in.

### Help

You can see all the commands available by executing:

```bash
$ qovery help
```

```bash title="Help output"
$ qovery help
A Command-line interface of Qovery platform

Usage:
  qovery [command]

Available Commands:
  auth        Log in to Qovery
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  console     A brief description of your command
  context     Setup the CLI context
  help        Help about any command
  log         Displays application logs
  status      A brief description of your command
  version     Print version information for the Qovery CLI

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for qovery
```

## Context

Context command lets you configure the CLI to work with your chosen application. Before executing other commands, you need first to set up the context.
The context is then remembered and used by the CLI. You can configure a new context anytime by running the `qovery context set` command.

### Set New Context

To set a new context, type `qovery context set`:

```bash
$ qovery context set
Qovery: Current context:
Organization | Qovery
Project      | test
Environment  | development
Application  | website

Qovery: Select new context
Organization:
✔ Qovery
Project:
✔ admin
Environment:
✔ main
Application:
✔ app

Qovery: New context:
Organization | Qovery
Project      | admin
Environment  | main
Application  | app
```

### Print Current Context

```bash
$ qovery context
Qovery: Current context:
Organization | Qovery
Project      | admin
Environment  | main
Application  | app

Qovery: You can set a new context using 'qovery context set'.
```

## Log

Log command allows you to display the application logs.

```bash
$ qovery log
  TIME                    MESSAGE
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019717       at /usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:17:16
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019721       at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019724       at Timeout._onTimeout (/usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:15:14)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019728       at listOnTimeout (internal/timers.js:557:17)
  # ... the rest of logs
```

By default, the last 1000 logs is displayed.

### Follow Logs

To make the CLI follow your logs, use `-f` flag:

```bash
$ qovery log -f
  TIME                    MESSAGE
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019717       at /usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:17:16
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019721       at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019724       at Timeout._onTimeout (/usr/src/app/autoFunctions/levels.js:15:14)
  Jul 15 08:46:13.019728       at listOnTimeout (internal/timers.js:557:17)
  # ... the rest of logs
```

This will make the CLI follow your application logs and append any new logs till you use `CTRL+C`.

## Status

Status command lets you print the basic status of your application.

```bash
$ qovery status
15 Jul 21 10:55 CEST
Application | Backend
Status      | RUNNING
```

## Console

Console command quickly opens the Qovery Console in your browser to let you display more information about your application.

```bash
$ qovery console
Qovery: Opening https://console.qovery.com/platform/organization/your-org/projects/your-proj/environments/your-env/applications/your-app/summary
```

## Shell

Shell command allows you to open an ssh connection with the container where your application is running (application selected via the cli context).

```bash
$ qovery shell
/ # ls
bin                   media                 srv
dev                   mnt                   sys
docker-entrypoint.d   opt                   tmp
docker-entrypoint.sh  proc                  usr
etc                   root                  var
home                  run                   www
lib                   sbin
```
<Alert type="info">
Keep in mind these limitations when using this feature:
<ul>
  <li>Install a process reaper as pid one in your container (i.e: dumb-init), as you may leave zoombie process in your container if your shell terminate unproperly (i.e: ctrl+c, cnx restart). This is a known issue with kubernetes exec to leave process alive after attach is closed;</li>
  <li>if your application is configured to run with more than one instance, you will be able to connect only to the oldest POD running one of your instances;</li>
  <li>shell is force closed after [1 hour, 10Mb transmitted];</li>
  <li>we use SH by default. To have auto-completion, start bash.</li>
</ul>
</Alert>

## Generate API token

To use the Qovery API you will need to generate an authentication token. To generate an API token you can install the CLI and type

<Alert type="warning">

Never share your API token with anyone.

</Alert>

```bash
$ qovery token

Qovery: Select organization
Organization:
✔ My Organization
Choose a token name
Token name: Romaric
Choose a token description
Token description: used for Github Actions
Qovery: ---- Never share this authentication token and keep it secure ----
Qovery: qov_4LnEg2wFxxxxxHObGSQ22rjBZZyyyySgyR6Y_2500882691
Qovery: ---- Never share this authentication token and keep it secure ----
```

To use your token and list your organizations.

```shell
curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Token qov_4LnEg2wFxxxxxHObGSQ22rjBZZyyyySgyR6Y_2500882691' https://api.qovery.com/organization
```
<Alert type="info">

The token can be used to interact programmatically with our API (directly, via our Terraform Provider etc..)
If you get a 424 error while trying to create new applications from one of your git repository, please make sure that the Organization Owner has access to the repository you are configuring for your app.
