The Logs interface allows you to access:
- **The deployment logs**: every time a deployment is triggered, Qovery provides you with the log of its execution and as well with any error that might occur. Note: As of now, Qovery can provide you only the log of the latest deployment execution.
- **The live logs** of your applications: Qovery allows you to retrieve the logs of your application in real time, streamed directly from your remote application (no data is stored on Qovery side).  The logs are accessible as long as the application is running and writing the logs in the `stdout`.

## How to access the logs

The `Logs` interface can be accessed from the console by clicking on the `parchment` icon available in the header or within the table

</p>

The interface is composed by two sections:
- A **navigation panel** (on the left)
- A **log section**

  <img src="/img/deployment/logs_view.png" alt="Log View" />
</p>

## Navigation Panel

This section provides you with some information on the last `Deployment` happened on the environment and as well a navigation system to access the logs of each services of your environment. 

More in detail you will find here:
- Last deployment information (top section): this section shows you the status of the last deployment execution and when it happened. If a deployment is ongoing, its status will be updated accordingly on this section. 
- Pipeline view: this section provides an overall view of the current configuration of the [Deployment Pipeline][docs.using-qovery.deployment.deployment-pipeline] and each services present within the environment. By default, only the services that have been deployed within the last deployment execution are displayed but you can still display all of them by un-ticking the option `Last deployed only`. 

## Log section

This section allows you to access the `Deployment Logs` and the `Live logs` of each service.

Once you click on one of the services on the `Navigation Panel`, the two logs will be loaded on separate tabs.

### Deployment Logs

This tab shows you the deployment logs of the selected service. 

<Alert type="info">

Qovery provides you only the logs of the last deployment, if your service has been deployed before within another deployment you won't be able to access its deployment logs. This feature will be developed in the future

</Alert>

While the deployment is ongoing and goes through the different steps (pull code, build, push image, deploy etc..), the system will show you the execution logs and as well some status updates on the ongoing deployment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deployment/deployment_status_update.png" alt="Deployment Status Update" />
</p>

At the end of the deployment, a final message is emitted confirming if the deployment was successful or not and, in case of issue, it provides you with some information on how to solve the issue.

</p>

You can use the [Troubleshoot section][docs.using-qovery.troubleshoot] to investigate any issue you might encounter during the deployment of your services.

### Live Logs

The live logs tab gives you a real-time view on the log generated by your application while running remotely on your cloud provider infrastructure. 

Within this section you will find:
- Timestamp: the timestamp of the message
- Pod Name: the name of the kubernetes pod where your application is running (to distinguish the instance in case of multi-instance app). If you want to follow a specific pod, you can filter the logs by clicking on the pod name
- Version: the commit id or the image tag of the application running on this POD
- Message: the log message

If you need to troubleshoot issues on the requests managed by your application, you can also access the Nginx logs in the same view (logs format is available in the helper). Note that this option is available only if the application is exposed publicly (See the [Port Section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#ports])
