When referring to clusters in the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console], we mean Kubernetes clusters. A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of node machines that allows you to run containerized applications. It is usually made up of:
* **Pods**: a pod represents one instance of an application in Kubernetes. It hosts one or several containers, as well as storage resources and network IPs. Pods are the smallest deployable objects in Kubernetes, and they are deployed to worker nodes.
* **Worker Nodes**: worker nodes run your applications and workloads. A worker node contains one or several pods, a container runtime (responsible for running containers), a kubelet agent (to check that containers are healthy and running in a pod), and a kube-proxy (to ensure seamless communication between the components of the cluster).
* a **Control Plane** (or **Master Node**): the control plane manages the worker nodes. It contains an API server (to query and modify the state of the cluster objects), a controller manager (to check that the current state of the cluster objects is as desired), a cloud controller manager (a controller manager for cloud provider-specific implementations), a scheduler (to assign pods to worker nodes) and an etcd key-value store (to store all the cluster objects).
A robust cluster can have several control planes, preferably in various geographical locations.

For more information on Kubernetes clusters, see [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/).

From the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console], you can manage the settings of the clusters you want to run on your infrastructure. The clusters are then created (or updated) by the cloud provider that hosts them.

## Creating a Cluster

* To create a cluster as an AWS user, see [Install a New Cluster on Qovery for AWS Users][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services].
* To create a cluster as a Digital Ocean (DO) user, see [Install a New Cluster on Qovery for Digital Ocean Users][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.digital-ocean].
* To create a cluster as a Scaleway (SCW) user, see [Install a New Cluster on Qovery for Scaleway Users][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.scaleway].

## Managing your Cluster Settings

To manage the settings of an existing cluster:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Open your [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console].

</li>
<li>

Access your Organization settings:


<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Organization_Settings_Access.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

To view your cluster options, click `...`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/More_Options_Clusters.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

In the dropdown menu, select `Settings`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Cluster_Settings_Access.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

The cluster settings window opens.

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

### General Information

The `General Information` tab allows you to define high-level information on your cluster:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Cluster_General_Information.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

| Item | Description |
|------------|---------|
| Cluster name | To enter or edit the name of your cluster.|
| Description | To enter or edit the description of your cluster.|
| Auto-update | (View-only, defined at cluster creation) To check if the Auto-update feature is enabled on your cluster. When the Auto-update is enabled, your cluster is automatically deployed again whenever a change is made to it.|
| Cloud Provider | (View-only, defined at cluster creation) To check which cloud provider your cluster is hosted by.|
| Region | (View-only, defined at cluster creation) To check which geographical location your cluster is hosted in.|

#### Credentials

To allow Qovery to quickly deploy your applications, you need to install it on your cloud provider account. To do so:

  * as an AWS user, see [Connect your AWS account][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services#connect-your-aws-account].
  * as a Digital Ocean (DO) user, see [Connect your Digital Ocean account][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.digital-ocean#connect-your-digital-ocean-account].
  * as a Scaleway user, see [Connect your Scaleway account][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.scaleway#connect-your-scaleway-account].

You then need to finalize the connection between Qovery and your cloud provider account from the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console]. 
To do so:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

In [your cluster settings][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#managing-your-cluster-settings], access the `Credentials` tab and click `Add`:

<p align="center">
      <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Credentials_Window.png" alt="Application" />
    </p>

The `New Credentials` window opens:

<p align="center">
      <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/New_Credentials_Window.png" alt="Application" />
    </p>

</li>
<li>

In the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` fields, enter the credentials you created on your cloud provider account.

</li>
<li>

Click `Save`.

Qovery is now connected to your cloud provider account.

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

    
#### Resources

Qovery allows you to define the resources you want to allocate to your cluster. 
To do so:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

In [your cluster settings][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#managing-your-cluster-settings], access the `Resources` tab:

<p align="center">
<img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Cluster_Resources.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

</li>

<li>

In the `Instance type` dropdown menu, select the type of worker nodes you want to deploy on your cluster:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Instance_Type_Selection.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

  If an instance type is missing, it means that either Qovery or your cloud provider does not support it yet. 
  Also, available instance types are not currently filtered based on the region you selected for your cluster.

</Alert>

  </li>
  <li>

  (Optional) Click the `Instance type selection helper` toggle if you need help to pick the best instance type for your needs. This allows you to input the desired CPU and/or RAM per worker node on your cluster, and the `Instance type` field value is updated accordingly.
  
  </li>
  <li>

In the `Node disk size (GB)` field, enter the disk capacity you want to allocate to your worker nodes (i.e how much data, in gigabytes, you want each worker node to be able to hold).

  </li>
  <li>

On the `Node` scale, define the range of worker nodes you want to deploy to your cluster.

  <Alert type="info">

  The lowest value corresponds to the number of worker nodes running on your infrastructure at any time, while the highest value corresponds to the maximum number of worker nodes that can automatically be deployed as traffic grows. 
  For more information, see [Auto-scaling][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#auto-scaling].

</Alert>

  </li>
  <li>

Click `Save`.

  </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>
