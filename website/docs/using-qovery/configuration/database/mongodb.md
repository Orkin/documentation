## Credentials

<Alert type="danger">

Your Docker image must contain the TLS certificate of the MongoDB cluster - it can be [downloaded here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem).

The application must be configured to use it. If you use the environment variables to build the URI to connect tou your database, you usually should have just append `&ssl_ca_certs=/path/to/the/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem` to its value.

</Alert>

Have a look at the [Database page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database] to know more about the database creation and setup.
