<Assumptions name="documentation">

You have created an [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment].

</Assumptions>

Qovery provides access to the most popular SQL and NoSQL databases available on the major cloud providers. Reliability and resiliency are at the heart of their services, so you don't have to worry about your data on Qovery.

<Alert type="info">

Check out [this video guide][guides.getting-started.create-a-database] to create and deploy your first database

## Create a database

<Alert type="info">
Please note that this section presents the general setup of a database. Depending on the database you want to use, have a look at the dedicated sub-page to get more information on the supported versions or any other database specificities.

<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Select your project and environment

</li>

<li>

Click `Add Database` button

<li>

Select database type, name, version, mode and accessibility

<Alert type="info">
Please refer to the Configuration section below to know more about each of these parameters.

## Configuration

### General

#### Modes

Databases can operate in two modes:

- Managed
- Container

**Managed** databases are perfect for production - they are provided and managed by major cloud providers like AWS to make sure your production data is well managed.

**Container** databases are managed by Qovery as Docker containers with attached persistent storage. They are perfect for development and testing, as they are significantly cheaper than services provided by cloud providers.

Please refers to the dedicated database sub-pages to get more information on the supported mode for each of our database types.

#### Versions

Please refers to the dedicated database sub-pages to get more information on the supported versions and all database configuration specificities.

You can adjust the version of your database in `General` section of database settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/database/db-6.png" alt="Database Version" />
</p>

#### Accessibility

To make your database secure, you may decide not to expose it publicly.

- **Public** access will make your database accessible via the public network
- **Private** access will make your database accessible only by applications in your environment

You can configure the accessibility settings in `General` section of database settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/database/db-6.png" alt="Database Accessibility" />
</p>

### Resources

#### CPU

To tweak CPU configuration of your database, navigate to `Resource` section in database settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/database/db-4.png" alt="Database CPU" />
</p>

#### Memory

To tweak RAM configuration of your database, navigate to `Resource` section in database settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/database/db-5.png" alt="Database Memory" />
</p>

#### Storage

To tweak the disk space assigned to your database, navigate to `Resource` section in the database settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/database/db-7.png" alt="Database Storage" />
</p>

## Credentials and connectivity

When a database is created in your environment, Qovery will automatically create and inject a set of BUILT_IN environment variables containing all the parameters necessary to your application to connect to the database.

This is the list of environment variables and secrets that will be automatically created:

| Name                | Description    | Example |                                                                                                                                                                          
|---------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_DEFAULT_DATABASE_NAME | Env Var containing the default database name | postgres |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_HOST | Env Var containing the external hostname of the database (if you need access from the outside and the DB is configured with visibility "PUBLIC") | zf5206c84-postgresql.oom.sh |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_HOST_INTERNAL | Env Var containing the internal hostname of the database (if you need access it from within the cluster network) | zf5206c84-postgresql |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_LOGIN | Env Var containing the username of the DB | superuser |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_PORT | Env Var containing the port to be used for connecting to the DB | 5432 |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_HOST | Secret containing the external URI to be used for connecting to the DB (if you need access from the outside and the DB is configured with visibility "PUBLIC") | sql://root:xxxx@z4a58c1e2-postgresql.oom.sh:27017/admin |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_HOST_INTERNAL | Secret containing the internal URI to be used for connecting to the DB (if you need access it from within the cluster network) | sql://root:xxxx@z4a58c1e2-postgresql:27017/admin |
| QOVERY_`<DATABASE_TYPE>`_`<DBID>`_PASSWORD | Secret containing the password of the DB | dbsecret |

Please note that the built-in variables follow the naming pattern: `QOVERY_DATABASETYPE` + <your_db_name> + <type_of_variable> where:

- `<your_db_name>` is the name of your database
- `<type_of_variable>` is the type of variable we inject, e.g. `PASSWORD`, `VERSION`, `CONNECTION_URI` and so on.

To know how to access your database from your application, [have a look at the database section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment-variable#connecting-to-a-database].

## Delete your database instance

<Alert type="danger">

Delete action drops the service and its data!

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

As Managed Services databases (like RDS) are mainly used for production, Qovery do not delete automated snapshots and backups on deletion.
It is up to the user or Cloud provider Administrator to delete it manually.

</Alert>

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Navigate to [Console][urls.qovery_console]

</li>
<li>

Select your environment and database

</li>

<li>

In database overview, click on `Action` remove button

<p align="center">
