## Creating an Organization

When signing up for Qovery, you need to create an organization. You can choose between 4 plans: **Free**, **Professional**, **Business** and **Enterprise**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/organization/Qovery_Pricing_Plans.png" alt="Qovery Pricing Plans" />
</p>

For more information, see [our pricing page] [urls.qovery_pricing].

Once you have chosen a plan, you need to sign in through your Git provider (Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket). Your organization is then created. 

To  manage your organization settings from the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console], click the cogwheel icon on the top right of the screen:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/Organization_Settings_Access_Button.png" alt="Organization Settings Access" />
</p>

In the `General Information` tab:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/organization/General_Information_Organization_Settings.png" alt="Organization Settings Access" />
</p>

* **Company name**: enter the name of your company.
* **Description**: enter a description of your organization.
* **Website**: enter the website of your company.
* **Admin contact emails**: enter one or several email adresses (separated by commas) on which you want to receive important communications from Qovery.

<Alert type="info">

We will **only** use your admin contact email details to send you communications about infrastructure outages, maintenance updates, and weekly and monthly usage reports.

</Alert>

Don't forget to click `Update` to save your organization information!

## Managing your clusters

With Qovery, you can manage multiple clusters in your organizations settings. You can then deploy your project environments and services to the cluster of your choice.

In the settings of your organization, you can add, stop and delete a cluster, as well as update its settings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/organization/multi-clusters.png" alt="Qovery - Manage multiple clusters in your organization" />
</p>

For more information, see [Clusters][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters].


#### What is the default cluster? 

The default cluster is the first cluster you installed in your organization. 

When you create a new environment and leave the `mode` and `cluster` parameters set to the value `Automatic`, your environment is deployed to:
* the cluster defined in one of [your project rules][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule#environment-deployment-rules],
* or to the default cluster if no project rule applies.

For more information on deployment rules, see [Project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project].

## Organization members

You can invite someone to join your organization by email. Then he will get access to your projects and will be able to contribute.

## Managing Git Permissions Using the Qovery Github App

When you first sign into the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console], you need to provide your Git provider account credentials. This allows you to later take advantage of a Single Sign-On process through your Git provider. 
However, by default, Qovery is then allowed to access all the resources stored on your Git provider account. 

For better control, as a Github user, you can install the **Qovery Github App**, and define which Github repositories Qovery can access.
<Alert type="info">

You can only link one Github Organization to your Qovery Organization through the **Qovery Github App**. 
Also, once the **Qovery Github App** is installed, all the members of your Qovery Organization will only have access to the repositories linked to your **Qovery Github App**.

</Alert>

### Installing the Qovery Github App


<Alert type="warning">
