<Assumptions name="documentation">

* You have a [created an account][docs.using-qovery.interface].

</Assumptions>

An organization is a shared account where developers can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and organization administrators
can manage:

- cloud accounts.
- members access.
- the billing.

## Create an Organization

You need to create an organization the first time you use Qovery. You have to choose between the **Free**, **Professional**, **Business** and **Enterprise**.

</p>

### How to choose between plans?

In a nutshell:

- **Free**, **Professional**, **Business** and **Enterprise** plans: to deploy on your Cloud account.
- **Community**: to get free hosting for your hobby project.

Get more info [here][urls.qovery_pricing].

## Manage your clusters

With Qovery, you can manage multiple clusters in your organizations settings. You can then deploy your project environments and services to the cluster of your choice.

In the settings of your organization, you can add, stop and delete a cluster, as well as update its settings.

</p>

For more information, see [Clusters][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters].

#### What is the default cluster? 

The default cluster is the first cluster you installed in your organization. 

When you create a new environment and leave the `mode` and `cluster` parameters set to the value `Automatic`, your environment is deployed to:
* the cluster defined in one of [your project rules][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule#environment-deployment-rules],
* or to the default cluster if no project rule applies.

For more information on deployment rules, see [Project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project].

## Organization members

You can invite someone to join your organization by email. Then he will get access to your projects and will be able to contribute.
