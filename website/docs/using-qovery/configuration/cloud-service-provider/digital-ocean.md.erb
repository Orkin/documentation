<!--
SCHEMA: Show a schema where Qovery is deployed on the account of the customer

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have a Digital Ocean account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your Digital Ocean account

To link your Digital Ocean account to Qovery you need to provide a Digital Ocean `access key id`, `secret access key` and a `personal access token`.

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one Digital Ocean account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your Digital Ocean credentials - `access key id`, `secret access key` and `personal access token`.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your Digital Ocean console](https://cloud.digitalocean.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `API`
<img src="/img/do-create-token-1.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/do-create-token-2.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/do-create-token-3.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy the generated `personal access token`.

<img src="/img/do-create-token-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/do-create-token-5.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy the generated `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/do-create-token-6.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your Digital Ocean `access key id`, `secret access key` and `personal token`; It is time to connect Qovery to your Digital Ocean account.

#### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow these steps to create a new cluster.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

Go to your organizations settings.
<img src="/img/organization-setting.png" />

</li>

<li>

On this page, you will be able to see the information and status or your clusters.

Click on `Add cluster` button.

<img src="/img/add-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

A modal is displayed, where you can specify the name of your cluster and the Cloud Provider.

Select the following Cloud Provider: `Digital Ocean`.

Once you have selected the cloud provider, you will be able to define the Region of your Cluster.

<img src="/img/do-select-provider.png" />

</li>


<li>

Here you can choose to set your cluster credentials straight away or later. To set them now, select the `Do you want to set credentials?` option.

If you have already set credentials on another cluster, they have been linked to your Qovery account and can be reused here. Just click on the one you want to use in the drop-down list.

If you want to use other credentials (or if you do not have any defined), click `+ new credentials` in the drop-down list.

<img src="/img/do-config-creds.png" />

</li>

<li>

A new modal pops up where you can specify the `Name of the certificate`, the `Spaces Access Key`, the `Spaces Secret Key` and the `Token`.

<img src="/img/do-new-creds.png" />

Click on `Save`to save the new credential and then `Next`.

</li>

<li>

On this step, you can select specific features you want to activate or deactivate on the cluster.

<img src="/img/cluster-features.png" />

<Alert type="warning">

You will not be able to activate/deactivate these features once the cluster has been deployed for the first time.

</Alert>

</li>

<li>

Once your new cluster is created, it will be listed in the cluster list. If you have finished configuring your cluster, click on the `...` and `Install` menu to start the cluster installation.

<img src="/img/install-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

Your cluster is now installing!

<img src="/img/installing-cluster.png" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>
