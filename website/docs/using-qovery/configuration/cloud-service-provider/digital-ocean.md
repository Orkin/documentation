Digital Ocean is no longer supported. [Read more...](https://www.qovery.com/blog/say-goodbye-to-digital-ocean-major-change-in-supported-cloud-providers)

</Alert>

Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Digital Ocean (DO)][urls.digital_ocean] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 20 minutes to install Qovery on your Digital Ocean account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your Digital Ocean account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have a Digital Ocean account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your Digital Ocean account

To link your Digital Ocean account to Qovery you need to provide a Digital Ocean `access key id`, `secret access key` and a `personal access token`.

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one Digital Ocean account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your Digital Ocean credentials - `access key id`, `secret access key` and `personal access token`.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your Digital Ocean console](https://cloud.digitalocean.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `API`
<img src="/img/do-create-token-1.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/do-create-token-2.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/do-create-token-3.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy the generated `personal access token`.

<img src="/img/do-create-token-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/do-create-token-5.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy the generated `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/do-create-token-6.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your Digital Ocean `access key id`, `secret access key` and `personal token`; It is time to connect Qovery to your Digital Ocean account.

#### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow these steps to create a new cluster.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

Go to your organizations settings.
<img src="/img/organization-setting.png" />

</li>

<li>

On this page, you will be able to see the information and status or your clusters.

Click on `Add cluster` button.

<img src="/img/add-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

A modal is displayed, where you can specify the name of your cluster and the Cloud Provider.

Select the following Cloud Provider: `Digital Ocean`.

Once you have selected the cloud provider, you will be able to define the Region of your Cluster.

<img src="/img/do-select-provider.png" />

</li>


<li>

Here you can choose to set your cluster credentials straight away or later. To set them now, select the `Do you want to set credentials?` option.

If you have already set credentials on another cluster, they have been linked to your Qovery account and can be reused here. Just click on the one you want to use in the drop-down list.

If you want to use other credentials (or if you do not have any defined), click `+ new credentials` in the drop-down list.

<img src="/img/do-config-creds.png" />

</li>

<li>

A new modal pops up where you can specify the `Name of the certificate`, the `Spaces Access Key`, the `Spaces Secret Key` and the `Token`.

<img src="/img/do-new-creds.png" />

Click on `Save`to save the new credential and then `Next`.

</li>

<li>

On this step, you can select specific features you want to activate or deactivate on the cluster.

<img src="/img/cluster-features.png" />

<Alert type="warning">

You will not be able to activate/deactivate these features once the cluster has been deployed for the first time.

</Alert>

</li>

<li>

Once your new cluster is created, it will be listed in the cluster list. If you have finished configuring your cluster, click on the `...` and `Install` menu to start the cluster installation.

<img src="/img/install-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

Your cluster is now installing!

<img src="/img/installing-cluster.png" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### Remove your Digital Ocean account

*this section is under development - [join us][urls.qovery_chat] and be part of the first to try it*

### Delete Qovery from your Digital Ocean account

<Alert type="warning">

Your applications and your data will be deleted.

</Alert>

To delete Qovery from your Digital Ocean account you must be the owner of the Organization.
Once your Digital Ocean account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.

## Regions

Qovery supports the following Digital Ocean regions:

| | name        | description
|-|-------------|--------------------------
|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸| nyc-1      | New York DC1 (USA)
|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸| nyc-3      | New York DC3 (USA)
|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸| sfo-2      | San Francisco DC2 (USA)
|ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸| sfo-3      | San Francisco DC3 (USA)
|ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±| ams-3      | Amsterdam DC3 (Netherlands)
|ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬| sgp-1      | Singapore DC1 (Asia)
|ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§| lon-1      | London DC1 (UK)
|ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª| fra-1      | Frankfurt DC1 (Germany)
|ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦| tor-1      | Toronto DC1 (Canada)
|ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³| blr-1      | Bangalore DC1 (India)

Qovery supports regions where [Digital Ocean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/) is supported.

## How Qovery works on Digital Ocean

Qovery is an abstraction layer on top of Digital Ocean and Kubernetes. Qovery manages the configuration of Digital Ocean account, and helps you to deploy production ready apps in seconds.
To make it works, Qovery rely on Kubernetes for stateless apps (containers), and  Digital Ocean for stateful apps (databases, storage...).

[Read more][docs.getting-started.how-qovery-works] on how Qovery works behind the scene.

### Kubernetes

The first time you set up your Digital Ocean account, Qovery creates a Kubernetes cluster in your chosen region. Qovery managed it for you - no action required. It takes ~15 minutes to configure and bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. Once bootstrapped, your Kubernetes cluster runs the Qovery app and is ready to deploy your applications.

### Managed services

Digital Ocean provides managed services for [PostgreSQL][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.postgresql], [MySQL][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.mysql], [Redis][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.redis], [MongoDB][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.mongodb]. Qovery gives you access to those services when you set the [environment mode][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule#environment-deployment-rules] to `Production`. In `Development` mode, Qovery provides containers equivalent, which is cheaper and faster to start.

### Security and compliance

Qovery runs your Kubernetes cluster and is autonomous to manage your applications, which means:
- Your configuration are stored on your Digital Ocean account.
- Your configuration is encrypted on your Digital Ocean account.
- Qovery can't access to your data.
- Suppose Qovery stops to run, your applications are not impacted.

## FAQ

### How to choose a region?

Different datacenters are located in different geographic areas, and you may want to keep your site physically close to the bulk of your user base for reduced latency.

### I don't find a region that is provided by Digital Ocean

We are probably testing the support of this region, please [contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us] to know what's the status

### Migrate between Cloud providers and regions

Today, you can't migrate an environment from one region to another after it has been created. Vote [here][urls.qovery_roadmap] if you need this feature.
