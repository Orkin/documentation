Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Scaleway (Scaleway)][urls.scaleway] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 10 minutes to install Qovery on your Scaleway account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your Scaleway account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

</Alert>

<!--
SCHEMA: Show a schema where Qovery is deployed on the account of the customer
-->

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have a Scaleway account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your Scaleway account

To link your Scaleway account to Qovery you need to provide a Scaleway `access key id`, `secret access key` and a `project id`.

<Alert type="warning">

If your Scaleway account is new, you need to open a ticket to Scaleway support to unlock your quota. You can post the following message:
"Hello, I am going to deploy my applications on Scaleway with Qovery. Can you increase my quota for current Kubernetes nodes type, to 10 please? Thanks"

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one Scaleway account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your Scaleway credentials - `access key id`, `secret access key` and `project id`.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `IAM`
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_IAM.png" />

</li>

<li>

Go to `Applications`
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_applications.png" />

</li>

<li>

Create a new application for your project
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_create_app.png" />

</li>

<li>

Generate your new API key from your application view
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_create_key_1.png" />
Set up the the preferred `Project` for `Object Storage` with your Scaleway Project
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_create_key_2.png" />

</li>

<li>

Save the generated `access key id` and `secret access key`.
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_creds.png" />

</li>

<li>

Go to `Policies`
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_policies.png" />

</li>

<li>

Create a new policy with `Principal` linked to the application you just created.
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_create_policy.png" />

</li>

<li>

Set the scope of the policy to your project
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_policy_scope.png" />

</li>

<li>

Select the following rules for your policy

<ul>

<li>
Containers permissions
<br></br>
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_perms_containers.png" />
</li>

<li>
Network Service permissions
<br></br>
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_perms_network.png" />
</li>

<li>
Compute permissions
<br></br>
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_perms_compute.png" />
</li>

<li>
Storage permissions
<br></br>
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_perms_storage.png" />
</li>

<li>
VPC permissions
<br></br>
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_perms_vpc.png" />
</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

Create your policy
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_apply_policy.png" />

</li>

<li>

Get you `project id` on your project dashboard
<img src="/img/scw-api-key/scw_project_id.png" />

</li>
</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your Scaleway `access key id`, `secret access key` and `project id`; It is time to connect Qovery to your Scaleway account.

#### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow these steps to create a new cluster.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

Go to your organizations settings.
<img src="/img/organization-setting.png" />

</li>

<li>

On this page, you will be able to see the information and status or your clusters.

Click on `Add cluster` button.

<img src="/img/add-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

A modal is displayed, where you can specify the name of your cluster and the Cloud Provider.

Select the following Cloud Provider: `Scaleway`.

Once you have selected the cloud provider, you will be able to define the Region of your Cluster.

<img src="/img/sc-select-provider.png" />

</li>


<li>

Here you can choose to set your cluster credentials straight away or later. To set them now, select the `Do you want to set credentials?` option.

If you have already set credentials on another cluster, they have been linked to your Qovery account and can be reused here. Just click on the one you want to use in the drop-down list.

If you want to use other credentials (or if you do not have any defined), click `+ new credentials` in the drop-down list.

<img src="/img/sc-config-creds.png" />

</li>

<li>

A new modal pops up where you can specify the `Name of the certificate`, the `Scaleway Access Key`, the `Scalewav Secret Kev` and the `Scalewav Proiect ID`.

<img src="/img/sc-new-creds.png" />

Click on `Save`to save the new credential and then `Next`.

</li>

<li>

On this step, you can select specific features you want to activate or deactivate on the cluster.

<img src="/img/cluster-features.png" />

<Alert type="warning">

You will not be able to activate/deactivate these features once the cluster has been deployed for the first time.

</Alert>

</li>

<li>

Once your new cluster is created, it will be listed in the cluster list. If you have finished configuring your cluster, click on the `...` and `Install` menu to start the cluster installation.

<img src="/img/install-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

Your cluster is now installing!

<img src="/img/installing-cluster.png" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### Remove your Scaleway account

<%= qovery_web_interface_coming_soon %>

### Delete Qovery from your Scaleway account

<Alert type="warning">

Your applications and your data will be deleted.

</Alert>

To delete Qovery from your Scaleway account you must be the owner of the Organization.
Once your Scaleway account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, databases, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.
