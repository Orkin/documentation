Using Gitlab CI with Qovery is super powerful and gives you the ability to manage the way that you want to deploy your applications. As the possibility are endless, I will share with you a couple of scenarios and pre-built scripts that you can use. Feel free to adapt them to your need.

```yaml
qovery:
  image: gitlab/dind
  services:
    - docker:dind
  variables:
    QOVERY_ORGANIZATION_ID: "xxx"
    QOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID: "xxx"
    QOVERY_APPLICATION_ID: "xxx"
  script:
    - docker run qoveryrd/qovery-action $QOVERY_ORGANIZATION_ID $QOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID $QOVERY_APPLICATION_ID $QOVERY_API_TOKEN $CI_COMMIT_SHA
```
