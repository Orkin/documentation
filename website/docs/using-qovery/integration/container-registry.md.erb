Qovery allows you to integrate with major container registries, enabling you to deploy your own container images or those available on public registries.

Today Qovery supports the following container registries:
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) (public and private)
- AWS ECR ([public](https://gallery.ecr.aws/) and [private](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html))
- Scaleway CR

You can define the list of container registry available to your team directly within the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console]. To know more about how to configure your container registry connection, have a look at [this section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization#container-registry-management]
