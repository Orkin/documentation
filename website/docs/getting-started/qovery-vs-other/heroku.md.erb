description: Discover what is the difference between Qovery and Heroku, and why Qovery is the perfect Heroku alternative for your business.

We’ve built Qovery to help developers and businesses to focus on the product they are building instead of managing their Cloud infrastructure. Our customers often tell us Qovery is the Platform-as-a-Service solution they would have made for their company. This page explains why so many former Heroku customers consider Qovery to be the best Heroku alternative.

> Qovery brings the Heroku experience on your AWS account. Available in minutes instead of months!

### When to choose Heroku
* You are looking for a hosting platform

* You need to host microservices and complex apps.

## Qovery vs. Heroku: a detailed comparison
### Qovery runs on your AWS account
Qovery runs on your AWS account, and this is the biggest difference with Heroku. The goal of Qovery is to simplify the access to the Cloud for any developer and company. Plug your AWS account into Qovery, and then you are ready to deploy your apps in just a few seconds! Qovery is installable on your AWS account in 20 minutes.

This is the opposite on Heroku. You can't use your Cloud provider account to host your apps and data. You must use the hosting provided by Heroku.

Qovery does not include your Cloud costs

</Alert>

### Cloud cost optimization
Where Heroku makes you consume more and more resources to spend more, Qovery does the opposite. We earn money because you use and love Qovery. And to fulfill our mission, we help you to reduce your Cloud cost by doing simple operations like:

* Automatically turning off unused resources.
* Autoscale up and down your apps according to real usage.
* Reduce the number of dependencies - which leads to lower costs and problems.

### Qovery lets you use your AWS credits
The advantage of using AWS as a startup or scale-up is to have access to free credits. As Qovery runs on your AWS account, you are free to use your credits. We also want to support you and give you free access to Qovery ([contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us]), then you can start as soon as possible to focus on your business without having to pay a penny.

*Heroku has a startup program, but it is not as generous as the one of AWS.*

### Better performance and reliability
As Qovery runs on your AWS account, You have to compare AWS to Heroku. Googling `Heroku vs. AWS performance and reliability` will find that benchmarks show that AWS provides better performance and reliability than Heroku at a lower cost.

### Infrastructure and DevOps control

* Heroku's infrastructure is hidden for good and bad reasons. The problem is that you have no control over it. Qovery relies on the managed services provided by the Cloud provider. You have full control of the type of resources you want to allocate and put your hands on if required. Qovery is transparent, where Heroku is a black box.

* Heroku focuses on the developer needs only, Qovery focuses on the developer needs and provides full control to a DevOps team via a plugin system. To go further than that, Qovery generates Terraform and Helm files (familiar to DevOps) to deploy the infrastructure and the developers' apps. If the DevOps is not satisfied by the default configuration of Qovery, they can change it.

### Qovery is built for privacy
Qovery does not host your apps and your data. Your data are stored on your AWS account. Even your app logs are stored on your AWS account and encrypted. Privacy is the present and the future; that's why Qovery is privacy proof by design.

### Qovery covers all regions
Low latency on your app means a better experience for your users. Being physically close to them is critical. That's why Qovery is available all around the world. Thanks to AWS and its global coverage.

| Region        | Qovery                       | Heroku    |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| North America | Yes                          | Yes       |
| South America | Yes                          | **No**    |
| Europe        | Yes                          | Yes       |
| Africa        | Yes                          | **No**    |
| East Asia     | Yes                          | **No**    |
| West Asia     | Yes                          | **No**    |
| Asia Pacific  | Yes                          | **No**    |

### Customer focus
Qovery offers all its customers community and email support staffed by the same world-class engineers who build the platform. Qovery’s product roadmap is public. You can submit feature requests and get notified as soon as we start working on them. This keeps us accountable and helps us understand your needs better. Heroku does the opposite. They don't involve their users and take actions for their own purpose.

### No vendor lock-in
1. Our [deployment engine][urls.qovery_engine] is open-source.
2. Reversibility: Your apps run on your AWS account. If you are not satisfied with our product, we give you access to all generated configuration files (Terraform, Helm, and others) and keep running your infrastructure.

Where Heroku is a black box. They do everything they can to lock you and keep you forever.
